## 🏆 SECTION 4: FOUNDER STORY

### **Headline:** "Built BY Youth Ministry, FOR Youth Ministry"

### **Story (condensed):**
```
As housing director for Mount 2000, I watched us pay Eventbrite $4,300 
in fees—while still needing separate tools for housing, check-in, and 
medical tracking.

None of these tools understood Catholic youth ministry. No fields for 
priests. No safe environment tracking. No three-tiered liability forms.

So we built ChiRho Events—the all-in-one platform we wish we'd had.

Now dioceses across the country save 30% while getting features 
specifically built for Catholic events.
